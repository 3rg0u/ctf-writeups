# States

Description:

```markdown
I have a favorite state (2-letter abbreviation for a US state) but it's a secret. If you can figure it out from this, I guessss you can know, too

state == 15 mod 31
state == 19 mod 23
state == 11 mod 47

Flag format - `byuctf{fullstatename}` (case insensitive)
```
